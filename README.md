## Features and Planned Updates
* Right now the watchface is only compiled for the original Pebble and Pebble Steel. I am currently working to make it function on the Pebble Time and Time Steel. Color options will eventually be added as well as Pebble Time Round support (monochrome icons and *possibly* color icons in the future.
* The weather/battery updates at every 30min interval automatically as well as every time the watchface is loaded. This may consume more battery life and I will look into it. I will also be adding 15/30/60 min intervals for automatic weather updates.
* Currently the watchface has basic/common weather icons, but I will be adding more accurate icons soon.
